How to update .dbf files used for importing:

1. Access Vic Datamart (https://services.land.vic.gov.au/SpatialDatamart/)

   An account is required to download datasets.

2. Download these 3 datasets:
    - Parcel Aspatial Table - Vicmap Property
    - Parcel Property Aspatial Table - Vicmap Property
    - Vicmap Address*

   Use the following settings for each file:
   Area: Whole of State : VIC (+4km)
   Format: ESRI Shape file
   Projection: _ Geographicals on GDA-2020

   *Vicmap Address will be split into two files .dbf files: ADDRESS.dbf and ADDRESS_1.dbf, this is to avoid dataset file size limitations when
   importing.

3. Once all files are downloaded run the "Shape to SQL" program and use the "File" option, then select option "1". Navigate to the downloaded location
   for the above files and select them all at once and run.

   Any existing datasets with the same name will be overwritten in the "Shapefiles" folder.


The new datasets can now be used using the import function to update SS_GUI.
